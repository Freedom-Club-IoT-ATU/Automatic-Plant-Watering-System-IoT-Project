# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System-IoT-Project
Internet of things project 2023/2024

Our project, "FloraBit" offers an innovative solution to address the challenge of houseplant neglect by introducing an automated drip feeding system controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. This system utilises self-plant watering spikes with adjustable valves, which are controlled by a stepper motor connected to the Arduino. Additionally, an LCD display will be integrated to show real-time flow rate information, providing users with valuable insights into the watering process.
